Who
---

* Maala Daryanani (linkedin.com/in/maala-daryanani-33b20325) in collaboration with Nitin Borwankar (http://twitter.com/nitin)
Based on community forming at [Google Group "learnds"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/learnds)

What
----

* A collection of Data Science Learning materials programmed in R.
* Associated data sets.

The initial beta release consists of four major topics

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forests
* K-Means Clustering

Each of the above has at least three R Notebooks covering

* Overview (an exposition of the technique for the math-wary)
* Data Exploration (the nuts and bolts of real world data wrangling)
* Analysis (using the technique to get results)

One or more of these may have supplementary material.
Each of these have worksheets that contain mostly the code sections so you can iteratively explore the code.

Three openly available data sets are used.

* For the Linear and Logistic Regression we use a data set on loans and interest rates provided by Learning Club http://learningclub.com
* For Random Forests we use a data set of Android accelerometer and gyroscope readings used to predict body position and motion from the Human Activity Recognition project

* UN data on economic indicators of countries

Why
---

There's a need for open content to raise the level of awareness and training in basics, in the Data Science
field with focus on R.

The R Notebook provide an appropriate platform for rapid iterative exploration and learning.

When
----

IPython notebooks are available since 2013. Using the same datasets, the R-notebooks are initialized in 2019 and intended to extend based on further improvements.

Where
-----

Today github, tomorrow the world.
